failed to create docker container: Error response from daemon: Conflict. The container name "/supabase_vector_SnapBot" is already in use by container "63a96a93611ad1299a77a16073c6573ced219803945f68971c6350f7e3883831". You have to remove (or rename) that container to be able to reuse that name.
Try rerunning the command with --debug to troubleshoot the error.
